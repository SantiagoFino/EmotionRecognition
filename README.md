# FacialEmotionRecognition
The main objective of this personal project is testing several Machine Learning Algorithms and preprocessing techniques on the classic Facial Emotion Recognition Problem.

It consists in two main parts. In the first one several image classification techniques are applied to identify the emotions in a person face. In the second one an API is developed to recognize emotions using ones camara.
## 1. Image Classification
The algorithms tested in this proyect are:
* ROI, Hue Saturation, GrabCut algorithm + LBPs for color + One class SVM
* Color conversion, histogram equilization, Watershed algorithm + Spatial gray-leveled dependence matrix (SGDM) + Kohonon NN
* AlexNet, AlexNetOWTBn, GoogLeNet, Overfeat, VGG
* Nine layer Deep CNN, PCA, augmentation

This ideas came from Pai, S., Thomas, M. (2021) A Comparative Analysis on AI Techniques for Grape Leaf Disease Recognition.
